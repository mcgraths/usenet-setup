My Usenet Setup
===============

The following is a general overview of how I have my media center nearly fully automated with Usenet. It makes use of the following components:

- **Usenet Servers** - Servers that contain the actual binary files
- **Usenet Search Providers** - Sites that index and moderate available binary files on Usenet servers.
- **SABnzbd** - Application that does the physical downloading
- **Sick Beard** - Application for automating TV Show downloads
- **Couch Potato** - Application for automating Movie downloads
- **Plex Media Server** - Applicationfor managing and serving all your TV Shows and Movies
- **Pushover** - Web service for sending push notifications to your mobile device (on successful download of TV Show or Movie)
